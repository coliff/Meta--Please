Meta, Please
=============

This website was started because I was tired of going to multiple sites to remember all of the different meta tags that were needed. First it was just the basics, then it was geo tags, and then most recently bringing in iPhone and mobile specific meta tags.

The goal of this website is to have one site that generates the most common meta tags. I don't assume that this is complete, as the web is a moving target. If there are tags that you'd like to add, send me a message or feel free to contribute via GitHub. This website will be a work in progress.
